# Memerizor
Take a photo or choose one from your library, use it to create a meme and share your own masterpiece with your friends and the rest of the world.

## Motivation for the project
It was an interesting challenge to become familiar with architecture of the user interface in iOS. Especially I like that you can start building and shipping working application with UI components “out of the box”, but later you can heavily customize them to make you application really stand out. When I started working on collection view controller I was so excited about flexibility of the controller and I did extra research and created another variation of the view controller when collection views spin as a casino roulette.

Secondly, I learned one of the most important design pattern in iOS. Delegation pattern appears in every application and provides a mean of communication between classes. Honestly I struggled in the beginning with this pattern, but when I get used to it I have to admit that it logical and straightforward. It is convenient to use for communication between classes. Another way to use delegates is to customize behavior and appearance of the other class.
Overall this was an interesting project to work on. Give it a spin and you can even send a meme to your friends with the Activity View!
